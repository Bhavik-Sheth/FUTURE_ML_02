# Customer Churn Prediction (ML Task 02)

This project analyzes customer data to predict churn probability using machine learning models. It identifies key drivers of churn and provides actionable insights.

## Project Overview

*   **Goal:** Predict whether a customer will churn (leave) and identify risk factors.
*   **Dataset:** Telco Customer Churn dataset.
*   **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

## Files

*   `Future_Interns_ML_02.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
*   `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`: Input dataset.
*   `Churn_Analysis_Report.pdf`: Generated PDF report with key metrics and visualizations.
*   `churn_predictions.csv`: CSV file containing churn probabilities for test customers.

## How to Run

1.  Open `Future_Interns_ML_02.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter.
2.  Run all cells to train the models and generate the report.
3.  Check the generated `Churn_Analysis_Report.pdf` for business insights.

## Key Features

*   **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and categorical encoding.
*   **EDA:** Visualizing feature distributions and outliers.
*   **Modeling:** Training multiple classifiers to find the best performer.
*   **Evaluation:** Confusion matrix, feature importance, and probability scoring.
